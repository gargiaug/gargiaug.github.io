<p> Hi, I am Gargi. I am awesome at many things, such as soccer. I'm awesome, right?</p>

I love to draw. My favorite painting is Starry Night. It was painted by Vincent Van Gogh. He was the dude who cut off his ear. Creepy, right?! </p>

<p> I am in 5th grade. I'm in Mrs. Olson's 5th and 6th grade combo class. In first grade, I had Ms. DiPalaremo. In second grade, I had Mrs. Borrelli. In third grade, I had Ms. Bell. Last year, in fourth grade, I had Ms. Kiet.</p> 
<p>I have many friends. I also go to tae kwon do. So, if you make me mad, I will kick or punch you. Just an FYI. </p>
